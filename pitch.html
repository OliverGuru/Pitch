    <h1>Why David Wants a Job</h1>
    <p1>
        This is an informal pitch so it wont be very professional and i'm trying to convince you
        guys to help me search for a job.
        This is helping me practice my html as well as pitch my "idea" to you guys
    </p1>
    <P>Now before i continue. I can't stress how grateful i am for all you guys are doing
        going the extra mile to make sure i'm very comfortable so your criticism and
        disapproval is still welcome.
    </P>
    <h3>Reasons.</h3>
    <p2>
        <Ul>
            <li>Well as you already know daddy is retiring this year so another stream of income 
                would be a welcomed idea </li>
            <li>Always asking you for money although you might disagree is inconvenient
                so i can always handle the small bills even at home</li>
            <li>It'll help me buld experience</li>
            <li>Well... more money</li>
        </Ul>
        
    </p2>
    <h3>Drawbacks.</h3>
    <p>It's important to note that i have little to no skills </p>
    <Ul>
        <li>School</li>
        <li>Time (feel like we need more hours in a day)</li>
        <li>Location (NOTHING ever works well in Nigeria)</li>
        <li>Finally lack of skills</li>
    </Ul>
    <h3>So what exactly am i lookng for?</h3>
    <P>So what i'm looking for (although it seems far fetched ) a job thats not soo demanding that 
        it will affect my studies and learning the web development. Or even a project that will fetch
        something for the four months that i'll be learning Web. </P>
